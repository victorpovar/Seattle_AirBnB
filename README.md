# Seattle AirBnB Analysis
This project is focused on the analysis of the Seattle AirBnB data. 

Below are the questions that served as motivation for this analysis:

1. Should the price be the same during every month of the year?
2. Should the price be the same for weekdays and weekends?
3. When should you be worried that the ratings will negatively affect the ability to charge desired prices?
